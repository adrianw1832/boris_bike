##Boris Bike

This project is from the week 1 weekly challenge of the Makers Academy course.
It introduces basic OOP and TDD concepts and is meant to ease us into pair
programming. This repo contains the solutions up to and including some parts of
post challenge 6 of the Boris Bike challenge, which has since been deprecated.
The code is meant to model a simple bike docking station, and later on, includes
a garage repair and van delivery system, all in IRB.

##Challenges

This was my first exposure to many new concepts in the programming world,
including TDD, OOP, pair programming and proper Github usage. It was pretty
overwhelming for the first couple of days, getting used to the syntax and working
with another person. I also found the whole concept and routine of TDD very
alien and difficult to get used to. Having said that, I was much more
comfortable with it at the end of the Week. Committing to Github was also so new
to me that I practically forgot about it.

##Technologies used

Ruby

RSpec

##How to install

Simply clone the repo and run IRB to play around, remembering to require the
needed files first.

Run rspec to run the tests.
